	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I am Alison Zhao and I am currently working as a pre-doctoral research professional at the University of Chicago, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank"> Becker Friedman Institute </a>. My research work focuses on political, behavioral and development economics, and I have a special interest in Chinese economy and society. </p>

	<p>In my free time, I keep a blog to tell stories with data (opinions and mistakes are my own), and I do photography if I finally get out of the room. </p>
